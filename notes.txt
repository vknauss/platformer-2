the combined view-proj matrix:
    essentially we need to specify the size and location of the viewport in 
    scene space. this can be done in a number of ways. for me i think the best
    would be the location (x and y coordinates) of the center, along with a zoom
    level and aspect ratio. this will avoid stretching along either axis and
    decouple scene space from screen pixels, which is good practice and will
    make game logic more stable (using a consistent coordinate system and
    smaller numbers, etc)

so how do we put this together?
    the first thing to do is translate the viewport so the center of the
    viewable space is at the origin. this is just a translation by the inverse
    (negative) of the center of the viewport in scene space. then we need to
    scale the space so the edges align with the ndc range (-1 to 1). So first
    that's gonna mean computing the actual scene space size of the viewable
    area. that's obviously gonna map from the zoom level according to some
    function, the easiest way being just a direct linear scaling along one of
    the axes. so let's just say the "zoom axis" is the x axis. this is gonna
    mean 

the equations:
x = (x - offset.x) * zoom / aspect
y = (y - offset.y) * zoom
z = z

now as a mat4 (homogeneous coords, column major, so maybe backwards lol)
[[zoom / aspect,               0,                 0, 0]
 [0,                           zoom,              0, 0]
 [0,                           0,                 1, 0]
 [ -offset.x * zoom / aspect,  -offset.y * zoom,  0, 1]]
